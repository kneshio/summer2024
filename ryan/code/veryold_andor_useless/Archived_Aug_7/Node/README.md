# v001_Florence_CLI
With this code, you are able to add images to an image folder that will then be procesesed. It will return the time it took to run along with the description/caption 

# v002_Florence_CLI
Same as v001 except, instead of downloading a model from huggingface everytime (and stored in cache), the model is already there! 

# v003_Florence_CLI
Puts everything into a JSON file so it can be read and understood later. Mostly used for furthur testing and analysis

# v001_ollama_llava
