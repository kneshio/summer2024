* June 3rd

Attended Orientation and Performed Training Tasks for the Week

* June 4th

Continued finishing Training Tasks

* June 5th

Started looking into papers to perform Super Resolution

* June 6th

Looked through 4 different papers covering the history of Super Resolution and detailed methods on  how to perform super resolution using Neural Networks and Transformer Based Methods

* June 7th 

Wrapped up findings into a Presentation, but the results of each of these methods did not seem very promising

* June 10th

Discovered GAN-based methods, specifically Real-ESRGAN, which also includes open sourced code and has very promising results
