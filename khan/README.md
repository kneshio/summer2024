## Preface

Computer Vision (CV), a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables computers to interpret visual data from images and videos by acquiring, processing, and analyzing digital images to extract meaningful information. Techniques such as image classification, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection are widely used in CV. These tasks rely heavily on deep learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are essential for effectively tracking objects and recognizing actions within visual data. CV empowers AI models, like Large Language Models (LLMs), to efficiently understand and identify objects and activities within visual data, thereby enhancing AI models' ability to comprehend and generate insights from multimedia content.

The objective of this project is to leverage the notion of object recognition, a particular CV task, in conjunction with an LLM to aid users in discovering, downloading, and asking about relevant images or videos. Dense captioning, especially when enriched with sufficient temporal data gleaned from videos, significantly enhances descriptive capabilities.

## Ideal Proposed Development Plan

- Develop or select an algorithm for image or video captioning at the edge.
- Use it to send alerts (via API) based on classification
    - Warnings (tornado, flood, accidents)
    - Information (flock of birds migrating, deer eating)
- Enable text (and image or video) search queries from sorted alerts.
- Implement client LLM or RAG for analysis on images.
    - Luminous objects (sun, reflection on solar panel)
    - Colors, number of cars and deformations on car
    - Predict next flock of birds using historical data
    - Why did they migrate (seasonal changes)
- Provide highlights of historical data from alerts with a recommendation system.
    - Cater to specific user intent with alerts recommendation system

## Further Research

Exploring improvements for LLMs, including [efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02528) and architectural considerations like Transformers, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and [Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07522), a Generalized Action Representation (GAR) broadly akin to [Husky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06469) could notably enhance the utility of LLMs.

I primarily research with [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) and [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com).
