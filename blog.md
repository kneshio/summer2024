# June 3rd

Attended Orientation and Performed Training Tasks for the Week

# June 4th

Continued finishing Training Tasks

# June 5th

Started looking into papers to perform Super Resolution. Attended a DOE weekly meeting event.

# June 6th

Looked through 4 different papers covering the history of Super Resolution and detailed methods on  how to perform super resolution using Neural Networks and Transformer Based Methods

# June 7th 

Wrapped up findings into a Presentation, but the results of each of these methods did not seem very promising

# June 10th

Discovered GAN-based methods, specifically Real-ESRGAN, which also includes open sourced code and has very promising results

# June 11th

Looked through different Real-ESRGAN implementations and compared each of the results. 

# June 12th

Briefly went through guides for connecting ssh into a gpu computer. Also attended the DOE weekly event.
